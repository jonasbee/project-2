## Overview

The second project is to **build a React application** that consumes a **public API**.

## Brief

- Consume a public API
- Have several ReactJS components
- The app can have a router - with several "pages"
- Include wireframes
- Be deployed online

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript & ReactJS
- React-Map-GL (for mapbox map)
- SCSS (Sass) & bulma.io
- WeatherAPI.com
- Git and GitHub
- Netlify (for deployment)

## Approach


### Setting the foundations

### Functionality

#### Popup when clicking on map

#### Getting weather information per coordinates

#### Render imperial and metric


### Known bugs

#### Hold down instead of click, layers

#### Same city/area, different country

### Potential future features

#### More information per coordinates
